<p>We are very excited to announce the official launch of OSPO Now, a company dedicated to open source. There's plenty for you to read on our website so we'll keep this post brief and just ensure you've seen the highlights.</p>
<h2>What is OSPO Now?</h2>
<p>We envision a world where organizations, guided by open-source best practices, achieve peak efficiency and innovation. Decades of progress in open source has led to principles that focus on transparency, fair access, and efficient development, these principles (which we simply call 'Open Source') can be applied to any business, whether you're using open-source code, writing your own, or just want to streamline your online workflows and processes.</p>
<p>Read about the <a href='/about.php'>mission and vision that drive us</a>.</p>
<h2>Our Services</h2>
<p>We offer a range of services to help your company on your open-source journey, from delivering open source training to upskill your team, to building a bespoke virtual open source program office (OSPO) dedicated to your company.</p>
<p>Check-out our <a href='/services.php'>full range of services</a>.</p>
<h2>Dedicated to open</h2>
<p>We don't want to be a company that tells you what to do without upholding the same principles ourselves. The <a href='https://github.com/osponow/website'>code to build this website</a> is openly available under a permissive open-source license (we'll write a blog about what that means in the future); if you notice a mistake on our website, please consider <a href='https://github.com/osponow/website/issues'>opening an issue</a> so we can fix it ASAP. As well as our code, all articles on our website are available under a <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/'>CC BY license</a>, which means you can access, share, and adapt them for free. Over time we will release more products and documents under open-source licenses to ensure we remain transparent and accessible.</p>
<p>Make sure to keep an eye on <a href='/updates.php'>our updates</a> and follow us on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/ospo-now'>LinkedIn</a> so you don't miss out.</p>
