Moreover, Brian Proffitt, Senior Manager or Community Outreach in the Red Hat OSPO, actually thinks that OSPOs are already plateauing and declining.

Unfortunately, the role of an internal OSPO is typically focused on community building which is costly, or in the words of Proffitt “stickers cost a lot of money!”.
