The term “user” does not refer to only detached end-users, but also the package developers, developers of downstream packages, and other stakeholders who may directly or indirectly interact with the software. We encourage co-design with suitable experts at regular stages throughout the project. The experts should be provided the chance to give feedback on the intended purpose and usability of the software to ensure it will genuinely solve the real-world problems that they/their community are facing, and to highlight any potential downsides to designs. As well as providing design input, we recommend early release of a prototype that users can trial in order to identify bugs or design flaws that can be fed back to developers.",[11,98,99],{},"While often seen as an administrative burden, documenting code is a useful method to center users in the code development process. Documentation increases usability by making the codebase more transparent and tells users and other developers how to interact with the code. As well as documented public-facing functionality, code commenting should be used for any code that is not intuitive; for example, long functions should have in-line code comments to keep track of progress through the function, and all functions should include very basic commenting at the start to outline inputs, outputs, and functionality.",[90,101,103],{"id":102},"s-sustainability","S: Sustainability",[11,105,106],{},"Software must be sustained over time and correctly marketed.

We define a “community” here as a “community of practice”: a group of people united around a common theme, in this case the software. This community could be a handful of users or thousands of users, depending on the needs of the software and the problem it is solving. Communities and users should not be forced to use software for the sake of it and if, over time, it becomes apparent that users are dropping off as the software is no longer required, then sunsetting (retiring) software is a natural endpoint.",[11,111,112],{},"Maintaining and sustaining code is simplest when a community is most active; however, even without an active community, code should be routinely updated and maintained.

Part of being equitable is therefore spending the time to determine and understand the target users and their varying needs and contexts. Once understood, software must be designed to be usable and accessible by all of those users. For example, a software package might be technically brilliant and tackle essential real-world problems, but if many users cannot use the software because they are unable to learn complicated new syntax, then the software has not been developed equitably.",[11,124,125],{},"Equitable code should also be findable (i.e., not simply dumped in a public software repository but also added to professional websites and other public resources), include clear instructions for installation and usage (this is a subset of documentation), and can be tailored to intended users with low-bandwidth (e.g., offline solutions are possible).
