At first glance this may seem like a big number, but when broken down by company size we see a different picture. The majority of companies with over 20,000 employees have an OSPO however below that number, less than a quarter of companies have an OSPO. Moreover, Brian Proffitt, Senior Manager or Community Outreach in the Red Hat OSPO, actually thinks that OSPOs are already plateauing and declining. According to Proffitt, the pandemic saw companies massively scaling back on their open source budgets including downsizing and decentralizing their OSPOs, this includes Red Hat. Unfortunately, the role of an internal OSPO is typically focused on community building which is costly, or in the words of Proffitt “stickers cost a lot of money!”.
